The Financial Loan report provides a comprehensive overview of the bank's lending activities through three dashboards: Summary, Overview, and Details. The Summary dashboard tracks key performance indicators such as total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. The Overview dashboard visualizes trends and distributions using charts based on issue dates, regions, loan terms, employment length, loan purposes, and home ownership. The Details dashboard consolidates all essential loan data into a user-friendly format for deeper insights into borrower profiles and loan performance.
